> ### Goals
My primary goal for the future is to enhance my technical skills and expertise in modern web development. Through the Africa Code Academy (ACA) program, I aim to master advanced coding techniques and tools such as React and TypeScript, as well as gain proficiency in version control with Git and GitHub. By successfully developing and deploying projects, like the quiz app, I hope to build a robust portfolio that showcases my abilities.
