> ### Goals
My primary goal for the future is to enhance my technical skills and expertise in modern web development. Through the Africa Code Academy (ACA) program, I aim to master advanced coding techniques and tools such as React and TypeScript, as well as gain proficiency in version control with Git and GitHub. By successfully developing and deploying projects, like the quiz app, I hope to build a robust portfolio that showcases my abilities. This, in turn, will help me secure a role in a leading tech company, where I can contribute to innovative projects and drive technological advancements.

In addition to career advancement, I aspire to use the knowledge and skills acquired from ACA to explore entrepreneurial ventures and contribute to the African tech ecosystem. By launching personal tech projects and engaging in community-driven initiatives, I aim to mentor future ACA students and share my experiences to help others succeed. Ultimately, I hope to become an active member of the ACA community, learning from the diverse perspectives of my peers and instructors while fostering a supportive and collaborative learning environment. Through ACA, I seek not only professional growth but also the opportunity to give back and make a positive impact in the tech community.
